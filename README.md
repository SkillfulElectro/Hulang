# Hulang : One of the First AI-Powered Programming Languages

- The goal of Hulang is to bridge the gap between human language and programming languages. It aims to unify the diverse tools and features found in various programming languages into a single, cohesive syntax. This syntax will then be compiled into the appropriate programming languages based on your specific needs.


## Why a new Programming language?
- Unlike traditional programming languages, Hulang is not exactly a programming language. Rather, it's a structured method for instructing AI on what to do using your Hulang code.

## Getting started
- Currently, there is no fully optimized compiler for Hulang. However, developing one is part of the future plans. For now, you can use `Specification/Hulang.xml` as the system prompt for your AI model. Then, provide your Hulang code to the AI, and it will compile it into the programming language of your choice.
- passed its tests with `llama3:70b` and `gemma2:27b`

## Conclusion
- In conclusion, Hulang allows you to write code once and compile it into various programming languages to meet your specific needs.
